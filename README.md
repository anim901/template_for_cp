# Template for Competitive Programming 

## What this template is all about:
* This template makes debugging faster and less tedious.
* It allows you to debug your code locally on your system without relying on online debuggers.

## What are its features:
* Works with any datatype (primitive or user-defined) using C++ templates.
* Debugging statements like `debug(variable_name)` do not interfere with the compilation process.
* Outputs debug information to a separate file (`Error.txt`) to prevent terminal clutter.
* A single `debug()` command handles all data structures and datatypes, eliminating the need for separate print statements.

## Benefits:
* **Faster debugging**: Saves time, which is crucial in competitive environments.
* **Reduces code redundancy**: No need for repetitive debugging logic.
* **Promotes reusability**: Can be reused across different problems.

## How it's made:
This template utilizes key features of C++:
1. **Templates**: Allows it to work with any datatype.
2. **Preprocessors**: Simplifies debugging and code usage.
3. **Fast I/O**: Speeds up code execution for competitive programming.
4. **Attention to detail**: Includes small optimizations like:
   - `#define nline "\n"` for efficient newline management.
   - Structured preprocessing to improve readability and maintainability.

## Why use this template?
Debugging effectively and efficiently is critical in competitive programming. This template ensures faster debugging, cleaner code, and better reusability, making it an essential tool for any programmer.
